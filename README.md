- No centralized system for appointment status updates

#### 2. **Fragmented Medical Records**
- Patient medical history scattered across paper files and multiple systems
- Difficulty in accessing historical medical reports during consultations
- Risk of losing critical medical documents
- Inefficient sharing of reports between doctors and patients

#### 3. **Prescription Management Issues**
- Handwritten prescriptions leading to misinterpretation
- No systematic tracking of ongoing medications
- Patients losing prescription records
- Difficulty in maintaining medication history

#### 4. **Limited Patient Engagement**
